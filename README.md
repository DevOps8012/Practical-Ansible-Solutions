## About the Video Course
	If you are looking for a simple IT automation engine that automates and fulfills your IT needs, Ansible is for you! With its handling multiple powerful automation tasks and its adaptability to various environments and workflows, Ansible is the perfect solution for your automation needs. This is achieved by connecting to nodes and pushing out small programs known as Ansible modules. Later the desired state is achieved by writing programs to the resource model. Ansible has a very efficient architecture that helps you manage your system with ease, providing a wide range of services such as container management, application deployment, and automating cloud provisioning.
Core concepts—such as setting up the inventory and playbooks for a finely tuned orchestration and then the deployment of the examples—are covered. Further, we'll take a look at conditionals and variables, thus organizing playbooks. We take a brief look at real-world examples and managing system life cycles. Then we cover container and cloud management and network automation along with a brief coverage of Tower and Galaxy.
Finally, you will attain a deeper understanding of Ansible usage and design, and will be well on the way to the design and management of your automation.
